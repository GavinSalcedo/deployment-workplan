# Deployment Workplan


## Pre-Deployment Preparation

This section is to document all the necessary preparation and objectives of the deployment process.


## Objectives:

- [ ] [Version Planning] - Define the scope and objectives of the new version release. Determine the new features, bug fixes, and improvements that will be included.

- [ ] [Branch Release Management Planning] - Set up a release management process to handle the version control, branching and merging of code changes.


- [ ] [Quality Assurance Planning] - Conduct initial functional testing locally on the release branch, plan all the support the QA team will be requiring from our end. (i.e. direct DB manipulation, resetting updated data.....etc)

- [ ] [Communication] - Develop a communication strategy to inform stakeholders, users, and support team about the upcoming release.


## Deployment Implementation 

To provide the developers in the Wookie team - How we execute the deployment process on a step by step timing.



## Objectives:

- [ ] [Code Review] - Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure code quality, adherence to coding standards and to catch any potential issues early.

- [ ] [Code Scanning] - Undergo code changes through code smells or code lint procedures, ensure to eliminate all the error logs being raised and apply the fixes accordingly to the code practices being followed by the team.


- [ ] [Define the release branch] - Align with the support team regarding the official deployment list, this is to be sure the upcoming version will be as expected from the initial deployment planning.

- [ ] [Update documentations] - Update all the necessary documentations such as release notes, user documentations and developer documentations.

## Post-Release Task 

To provide the developers in the Wookie team - How we execute the deployment process on a step by step timing.



## Objectives:

- [ ] [Monitoring and Support] - Monitor all the issues that will be raised by the QA, provide immediate support.

- [ ] [Bug Tracking and Resolution] - Be keen to keep track of all the bugs and fixes to ensure that the latest codes changes are intact with the release notes and expected app behavior.


- [ ] [User Training and Communication] - Conduct user training sessions to familiarize users with new features and changes.
